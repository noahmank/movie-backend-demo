Demo backend RESTful API for a movie management system


Initial implementation of a Backend RESTful API to manage, search, and like/dislike movies. Uses JPA to persist to a PostgreSQL database (source can be modified in application.properties file).

Potential Improvements:
- Constraints on the Movie class fields with validation
- Additional searching options (e.g. get by highest to lowest rating)
